Horiseon Sample 22 Update


Horiseon hired me to update the backend of their HTML to make the coding easier to read for their current and possible future coders.  My main changes included changing most of the <div> to semantic elements to each section is more understandable.  I learned that when coding, it is always easier to make things as easy to read as possible.  This includes using easier semantic elements, adding notes to each section to map out what that section does, and spacing everything so it has a cleaner look.

## Installation
The website is already a go, and the usage has not changed from before the update.

## Usage
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
## Credits
I had help from several of my study group members:
